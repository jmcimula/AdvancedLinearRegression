Problem description
The ‘Ozone’ data from mlbench package contains the Los Angeles ozone pollution data collected in 1976. It is available as a data frame with 366 rows and 13 variables, that may be helpful to explain the ozone reading in the region. It is now up to us to find out which of the available variables would suit best to predict the ozone reading with maximum accuracy. The objective of this analysis is to accurately predict the ‘daily maximum one-hour average ozone reading’, using linear regression models. We will ensure this by making a 80:20 split of the data as development and validation samples, and use only the 80% sample for building linear models(training).

The models thus built will be used to predict the ozone reading on the 20% validation sample. With the actual ozone readings from 20% validation sample and model predictions thus computed, we will calculate the prediction accuracy and use it as one of the important parameters to decide the optimal model that suits this problem.
